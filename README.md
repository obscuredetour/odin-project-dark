## How to use

You should be using the browser add-on [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html). Do **not** use Stylish as it has security issues. For reference, [Stylus on GitHub](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus).

[Stylus for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) - this works on the mobile version too!

[Stylus for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en)

Next, you can simply go to [OpenUserCSS](https://openusercss.org/theme/5bbfc9e57dd88f0c002c0713) or [Userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/154701/the-odin-project-dark) and install it.
